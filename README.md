# lichtspiel
A casual implementation of a physically based rendering engine using the [PBR book](https://pbr-book.org/).
The goal is to rediscover Rust and gather some knowledge about ray tracing.

> *lichtspiel* is German and describes a natural or artificial light (German: Licht) that is perceived as particularly aesthetic and playful (German: Spiel)
